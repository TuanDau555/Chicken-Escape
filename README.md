# Chicken-Escape
Hello everyone! This is the first time I'm pushing a project to github
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at the Vietnam Aviation Academy, and this is my first project so far. You can find and play it on itch [here](https://tuandau.itch.io/chicken-escape).

## About the game
This game is made with Unity Engine
### Story
You're a chicken who's had enough of humans taking your eggs. One day, you decide it's time for paybackâ€”steal all their money and make a grand escape!
