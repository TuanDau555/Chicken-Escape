# Chicken-Escape
Hello everyone! This is the first time I'm pushing a project to github. <br>
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at the Vietnam Aviation Academy, and this is my first project so far. You can find and play it on itch [here](https://tuandau.itch.io/chicken-escape). <br>
This is my first completed game after six months of learning Unity. The journey was full of challenges, but also incredibly rewarding. I had so much fun creating this, and I’d love for you to follow me on [Itch](https://tuandau.itch.io/) for more games in the future!
## About the game
### Engine
Unity
### Story
You're a chicken who's had enough of humans taking your eggs. One day, you decide it's time for payback—steal all their money and make a grand escape!
